# LaTeX math

`EnrichedMarkdownText` renders LaTeX math natively, both inline and as block equations:

- **Inline math** (`$...$`) flows within the surrounding text and works in either flavor.
- **Block math** (`$$...$$`) renders as a standalone display equation. A display block needs the segmented renderer, so it requires [`flavor="github"`](/react-native/guides/markdown-flavors) - in `commonmark`, a `$$...$$` on its own line falls back to inline typesetting.

Math parsing is **on by default**. You can turn it off so `$` is treated as plain text, and exclude the native math engine to shrink your binary - see [Reducing app size](#reducing-app-size).

Block equations render as standalone display elements with their own spacing and an optional background (`markdownStyle.math`); inline math inherits the surrounding block's typography and takes only a color (`markdownStyle.inlineMath`).

:::important
LaTeX commands use backslashes (`\frac`, `\alpha`). In regular JS strings and template literals a backslash is an escape character, so use `String.raw` (as above) or double every backslash (`\\frac`). Block math (`$$...$$`) must be on its own line to render as a display element.

## Reducing app size

Native LaTeX rendering relies on [RaTeX](https://ratex.lites.dev/), a KaTeX-compatible math engine bundled by default on iOS and Android. If you don't need math, you can stop parsing it or exclude the native engine entirely to shrink your binary. The exact configuration is platform-specific - see the [Reference](#reference).

:::note
LaTeX math is not yet enabled on macOS.

## Reference

<CodeTabs groupId="platform">
<Tab label="React Native">

- [`md4cFlags.latexMath`](/react-native/api-reference/enriched-markdown-text#latexmath) - toggle math parsing (on by default).
- [`markdownStyle.math`](/react-native/api-reference/style-properties#math-block-specific) and [`inlineMath`](/react-native/api-reference/style-properties#inline-math-specific) - display and inline equation styling.
- **Reduce app size** - set `md4cFlags={{ latexMath: false }}` to stop parsing, or `"enableMath": false` in the `enriched-markdown` block of your `package.json` to exclude RaTeX from the native build. See [Native assets](/react-native/guides/native-assets#reducing-binary-size) for the full opt-out.
- **Web** - math renders through KaTeX, an optional peer dependency. See [Web support](/react-native/guides/web-support#math-katex).
